#  MoBot - Mobile Robot Simulation

Welcome to **MoBot**! This project is designed to simulate a mobile robot, providing functionalities for image analysis, text command processing, and robot movement simulation in a virtual environment.

> **Note**: This is the first phase of a larger project, with the ultimate goal of implementing these functions on a real robot by the end of the year.

##  Overview

MoBot aims to help analyze the robot's environment and respond to user text commands, while simulating its movements. We are using a collection of images donated by our teachers to help train and refine our work.

###  Key Features

MoBot offers three core functionalities:

1. **Image Processing**
   - Detects a ball in the image and returns:
     - The coordinates of its center
     - Its color
     - Its diameter
     - Its area

2. **Text Processing**
   - Interprets user text commands and deduces the corresponding actions to be performed by the robot.

3. **Robot Movement Simulation**
   - Simulates robot movements in a virtual environment based on the image and text input data.
