This program is used to simulate a mobile robot, so we're looking to analyze the environment, take into consideration user text requests and simulate the robot's movement. 
This is the first part of the project, which at the end of the year aims to implement these functions on a real robot.
We have a bank of images donated by our teachers, which we use as a basis for our work.

This program serves 3 functions:

1st function: Image processing, the program detects the ball on the photo and gives us :
-the coordinates of its center on the image
-its color
-its diameter
-its area

2nd function: Text processing, when the user enters a text command, the program deduces the functions to be performed, for example 

3rd function: Simulate robot movements in a virtual environment
